# Intersmash Tests

## WildFly MicroProfile Reactive Messaging + Kafka

This tests validates an interoperability use case based on a WildFly/JBoss EAP XP MicroProfile Reactive
Messaging interacting with a remote Kafka/Streams for Apache Kafka service.

## WildFly Elytron OIDC client + Keycloak

This tests validates an interoperability use case based on a WildFly/JBoss EAP/JBoss EAP XP application that 
uses the Elytron subsystem to configure an OIDC client for a remote Keycloak/Red Hat Build of Keycloak service,
which is configured to allow OIDC Single-sign-on in order to secure the application resources.

The deployed application descriptor sets the `SSO_OIDC_KEYCLOAK_URL` environment variable to the URL of the Keycloak service.

We have two variations of this test:

- one where the OIDC Client is programmatically registered in Keycloak through the `KeycloakRealmImport` CRD
- one where the OIDC Client is automatically registered in Keycloak by setting the specific `OIDC_*` S2I env variables

## WildFly SAML Adapter client + Keycloak

This tests validates an interoperability use case based on a WildFly/JBoss EAP/JBoss EAP XP application that
uses the SAML Adapter client to connect to a remote Keycloak/Red Hat Build of Keycloak service,
which is configured to allow SAML Single-sign-on in order to secure the application resources.

The deployed application descriptor sets the necessary environment variables described in [keycloak/2.0/module.yaml](https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-cekit-modules/blob/main/jboss/container/wildfly/launch/keycloak/2.0/module.yaml) to configure the connection to the Keycloak service and to trigger the automatic SAML Client registration.

## WildFly EJB + SAML Adapter client + Keycloak

This test is basically the same as [WildFly SAML Adapter client + Keycloak](#wildfly-saml-adapter-client--keycloak) and
also tests that the EJB layer is correctly configured and authentication and authorization data is propagated to the EJB layer;

## WildFly EJB + Bootable Jar + SAML Adapter client + Keycloak

This test is a simplified version of [WildFly EJB + SAML Adapter client + Keycloak](#wildfly-ejb--saml-adapter-client--keycloak) which removes signing for SAML requests and responses; it packages and deploys the application as a Bootable Jar; the peculiarity of this test is that the deployed application uses layer `keycloak-client-saml-ejb` which is meant for bare-metal usage not Kubernetes/OpenShift, and expects it to work since there is no reason why it should not;

## WildFly Web cache offload + Infinispan

This tests validates an interoperability use case based on a WildFly/JBoss EAP/JBoss EAP XP application which
interacts with a remote Infinispan/Red Hat Data Grid service.

The application is configured to use an invalidation cache backed by the remote Infinispan/Red Hat Data Grid service,
and environment variables are set conveniently in [the relevant application descriptor](src/test/java/org/jboss/intersmash/tests/wildfly/web/cache/offload/infinispan/WildflyOffloadingSessionsToInfinispanApplication.java). 

## WildFly + ActiveMQ Artemis

This tests validates an interoperability use case based on a WildFly/JBoss EAP/JBoss EAP XP application which
interacts with a remote ActiveMQ Artemis messaging broker service.

The application is configured to use TLS to secure the connection to the remote ActiveMQ Artemis messaging broker service,
and environment variables are set conveniently in [the relevant application descriptor](src/test/java/org/jboss/intersmash/tests/wildfly/message/broker/activemq/artemis/ssl/WildflyJmsSslApplication.java). 

## WildFly + ActiveMQ Artemis JMS Bridge

This test validates an interoperability use case based on a WildFly/JBoss EAP/JBoss EAP XP application which
is configured with a JMS bridge that forwards messages from a local queue to a remote ActiveMQ Artemis (AMQ Broker)
service.

The test verifies that messages are correctly delivered through the JMS bridge and that the bridge handles
broker unavailability gracefully by reconnecting and delivering parked messages once the broker is restored.
